This is the website of the international research software engineering community.  

Research Software Engineers are people who combine professional software expertise with an understanding of research. They go by various job titles but the term Research Software Engineer (RSE) is fast gaining international recognition.

# About this site

In January 2018, leaders of national RSE associations, groups and related initiatives from around the world came together in London for the first International RSE Leaders Workshop. This website and some initial blog posts (see [blog](https://researchsoftware.org/blog.html)) were created by breakout groups at this meeting.

The International Network of RSE Associations was established as a loose grouping of the people leading national associations, but in January 2021 the
International Council of RSE Associations was created as a forum to communicate and formally meet to ensure cohesion between associations and to provide a platform
for open discussion around international issues and affairs. For more information, please see the [Council](https://researchsoftware.org/council.html) page.
