The different existing [national and multinational associations](./assoc.md)
have always informally talked and collaborated by a variety of means.

The **International Council of RSE Associations** (*the Council*) provides a
formal open forum for established national and multinational RSE associations
to talk and coordinate about RSE-related issues regularly, and thus sustain international collaboration around research software engineering/engineers.

The Council consists of delegates from the established RSE associations, who
meet regularly to coordinate, discuss and collaborate around research software engineering/engineers. It is governed by a
[charter](council/charter.html). Further national or multinational RSE
associations can join the Council once they pass a threshold for establishment
that is defined in the charter.

To maintain openness towards the community and facilitate further knowledge
exchange and support, representatives of nascent communities can join Council
meetings as observing participants, ask questions and discuss issues at the
end of meetings.

To get in touch with the Council, write an email to  
ðŸ“§ [intl-rse-council@listserv.dfn.de](mailto:intl-rse-council@listserv.dfn.de).

The Council has a [*Code of Conduct*](./council/code-of-conduct.md), and you are expected to honour it in any participation in or interaction with the Council.
