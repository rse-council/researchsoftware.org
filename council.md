The different existing [national and multinational associations](./assoc.md) 
have always informally talked and collaborated by a variety of means.

The **International Council of RSE Associations** (*the Council*) provides a 
formal open forum for established national and multinational RSE associations 
to talk and coordinate regularly, and thus sustain international collaboration.

The Council consists of delegates from the established RSE associations, who
meet regularly to coordinate, discuss and collaborate. It is governed by a 
charter (currently being drafted). Further national or multinational RSE 
associations can join the Council once they pass a threshold for establishment 
that is defined in the charter.

To maintain openness towards the community and facilitate further knowledge
exchange and support, representatives of nascent communities can join Council 
meetings as observing participants, ask questions and discuss issues at the 
end of meetings.

To get in touch with the Council, write an email to  
📧 [intl-rse-council@listserv.dfn.de](mailto:intl-rse-council@listserv.dfn.de).
