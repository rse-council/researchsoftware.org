# How to contribute to the pages of the International Council of RSE Associations

## What to do when member associations' representatives change? 🧑‍🤝‍🧑

Some things need to be done by different **parties** if the representatives for a member association change:

1. A **member of the [GitHub team *council-members*](https://github.com/orgs/rse-council/teams/council-members)** adds new, and removes parting, representatives from the [GitHub team *council-members*](https://github.com/orgs/rse-council/teams/council-members).
2. **New representatives** [create a pull request](https://github.com/rse-council/researchsoftware.org/edit/main/council.md) that removes the information of parting representatives from, and adds their own information to, the [list of representatives on the main Council page](https://github.com/rse-council/researchsoftware.org/blob/main/council.md#current-members).
3. **New representatives** subscribe to the [internal RSE Council mailing list](https://www.listserv.dfn.de/sympa/subscribe/intl-rse-council-internal) and the [public RSE Council mailing list](https://www.listserv.dfn.de/sympa/subscribe/intl-rse-council). The **mailing list moderators** remove parting representatives from the internal mailing list.
4. **New representatives** join the [UK RSE Slack workspace](https://society-rse.org/join-us/#slack), and ask the internal mailing list to be added to the channel [#intl-rse-council](https://ukrse.slack.com/archives/G01KNLPLJ85). **Current representatives** add new representatives to the channel and remove parting representatives.
